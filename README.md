# Project

This project was made in Laravel 10, which require at least PHP 8.1 version.

## Filament
Filament was used to make a starter admin panel (provides us a login and a dashboard page).

To install it in new Laravel applications:
`composer require filament/filament`

After that we can make a new user in the terminal with the help of this command:
`php artisan make:filament-user`
